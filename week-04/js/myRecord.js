        lyrics: "I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, Been over the edge for yonks, Been working me buns off for bands, I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, Like the most of us, very hard to explain why you're mad, Even if you're not mad"

        duration: 169,
        authors: 'Roger Waters, Richard Wright, David Gilmour',
        lyrics: "Breathe, breathe in the air, Don't be afraid to care, Leave, but don't leave me, Look around, choose your own ground, Long you live and high you fly, Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry, And all you touch and all you see, Is all your life will ever be, Run, rabbit, run, Dig that hole, forget the sun, When, at last, the work is done, Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one, Long you live and high you fly, But only if you ride the tide, Balanced on the biggest wave, You race towards an early grave"

        duration: 413,
        authors: 'Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright, David Gilmour',
        lyrics: "Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day, Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way, Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown, Waiting for someone or something to show you the way, Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain, You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today, And then one day you find ten years have got behind you, No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun, And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking, Racing around to come up behind you again, The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, Shorter of breath and one day closer to death, Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time, Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines, Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way, The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say, Home, home again, I like to be here when I can, And when I come home cold and tired, It's good to warm my bones beside the fire, Far away across the field, The tolling of the iron bell, Calls the faithful to their knees, To hear the softly spoken magic spells"

        lyrics: "Money, Get away, You get a good job with more pay and you're okay, Money, It's a gas, Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash, New car, caviar, four star, daydream, Think I'll buy me a football team, Money, Get back, I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack, Money, It's a hit, Don't give me that do goody good bullshit, I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set, And I think I need a Lear jet, Money, It's a crime, Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie, Money, So they say, Is the root of all evil today, But if you ask for a rise, It's no surprise that they're giving none away, Away, away, away, Away, away, away, I was in the right, Yes, absolutely in the right, I certainly was in the right, Yeah, I was definitely in the right, that geezer was cruisin' for a bruisin', Yeah!, Why does anyone do anything?, I don't know, I was really drunk at the time, Just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two, He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven, And after, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why, It wasn't coming up on freight eleven"

Dig it?, I mean he get off lightly, 'cause I would've given him a thrashing, I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?', Down (down, down, down, down), And out (out, out, out, out), It can't be helped that there's a lot of it about, With (with, with, with), without, And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?, Out of the way, It's a busy day, I've got things on my mind, For the want of the price, Of tea and a slice, The old man died"
